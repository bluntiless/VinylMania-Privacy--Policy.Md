# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

VinylMania is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by VinylMania.

## Information Collection

### Information You Provide to Us

VinylMania collects only the information you explicitly provide:
- Audio recordings you create within the app
- Images you import as album artwork
- Audio files you import into the app

### Information We Collect Automatically

The app does not collect any data automatically. All your content remains stored locally on your device.

## How We Use Your Information

VinylMania uses your information solely for the purpose of providing app functionality:
- Storing and playing back your audio files
- Displaying album artwork you've added
- Managing your vinyl record collection within the app

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device. VinylMania does not use cloud storage or sync services unless you explicitly use iOS backup features.

## Microphone Access

VinylMania requests microphone access solely for the vinyl recording feature. Audio recorded is saved directly to your device and is not transmitted elsewhere.

## Third-Party Services

VinylMania does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent or trade your information with any third parties.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you maintain complete control. You can delete any recordings, albums, or artwork at any time within the app.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
